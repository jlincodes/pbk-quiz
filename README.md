# Pottery Barn Kids Quiz
[Live Site Hosted on Github Pages](https://julielin0812.github.io/pbk-quiz/)

## Languages/Technologies/Tools Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- vanilla JavaScript for the image slideshow
- Adobe Dreamweaver to fetch assets and some styling from the PSD file
- Git version control
- Github Pages to host a live version

### Adobe Dreamweaver vs Photoshop
Although I had zero experience with either of these tools, a simple Google search lead me to a quick tutorial on how to utilize Dreamweaver to extract assets and even some CSS from the original Photoshop composite. It took a few hours to set up and learn how to navigate through the software, but the time invested in learning how to use a new tool paid off in the end.

However, I did find myself often switching back to my regular text editor (Atom) and Chrome Dev Tools to edit HTML/CSS and experiment different styling. I also used Preview to view the JPEG version of the mockup to determine some CSS styling such as distances between elements in pixels.

### Image Slideshow
For the image slideshows, I decided to take a little creative liberty and make all three slideshows the same in terms of functionality. I had already created a slideshow in a [previous frontend project](https://julielin0812.github.io/rg-front-end-dev-test/) and decided to reuse that functionality. However, I did have to make a slight modification to make it work with multiple slideshows on the same page. In addition, I added a `setInterval()` to make a call to the change slide function every three sections as a sort of slideshow "autoplay".

## Thing(s) that I intentionally left out, but would like to build if time permitted:
- Dropdown menus upon hover for site navigation
- Refactor my CSS
  - I considered using SCSS, however, I decided to stick to what I was already familiar with. I was already utilizing extra time to learn a new tool (Dreamweaver), so I decided not to spread myself too thin to be more efficient with the time I had.
